### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP (examples)

- Pull data using google json api
- Render data on page 
- Allow user to choose favorites 
- Save their choices in firebase

#### PostMVP 

- Anything else that is not MVP

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions.  Try and capture what logic would need to be defined if the game was broken down into the following categories.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

}
```

## Issues and Resolutions
***Major:***

- My understanding of media was unclear until it was explained by Monica and Kenny. Spent 1/2 a day fixing it and it looks...decent.

- Aligning the cards for the projects for different view points has been challenging.

-Margins are great and a nuisance.  I think I am getting the hang of how and when to use them.

***Minor:***

-Adding images should have been an easy task and yet it gave me  1/2 day of problems, but it appears to be working now.

-Adding animations is more work than I thought.  So, I didn't include it in this project.  Hopefully I will be able to in future projects.


<!-- ERROR MESSAGES -->
**ERROR**:Error in DevTools for uploading images. 
**RESOLUTION**: It appeared I did not update my gsheet with the updated deploy links and imgur had issues with loading images. Also, Fire Fox is the enemy and will not load the page correctly.
